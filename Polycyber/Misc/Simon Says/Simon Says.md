## Downloadable challenge

We are given an executable file (.exe), and the description says explicitly `this is not a reverse challenge`, so that got me interested.

Upon running, it's obvious that it's an executable made with pygame, so at this point we have two paths:

- We extract the code from the executable using `pyinstxtractor` and `uncompyle6` or similar tools (The easier, more logical solution)
- We run the game and find other ways to exploit this specific case (Very specific, but got me interested)

**So, I went with the second path.. a choice which I will come to semi-regret later**

# Analyzing the application

---------------------------------------------------------

## Prompt
As seen from the challenge description, the application spits out 400 different colors in particular sequence, and we must re-enter the colors in that same sequence so we get the flag.
## Runtime Debugging

*When running the application, we see that it's very inconsistent, it keeps lagging if we move it and crashes without notice, so that was annoying during the test cases*

Once we press play, the application starts spitting out the colors, it has 4 colors, Red Blue Yellow and Green, in a grid format as shown in the picture:

And so on...

# Plan of attack:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- One idea I had was to record the application window, write a script to split the video into frames, and analyze each frame to get the dominant color, add it to a list and then re-input items in the list as mouse-clicks on given screen coordinates.
- **This idea seemed very new to me as I've never done anything similar to it before, and had no idea where to start, we were low on time aswell but I decided to go through with it. Writing the script proved to be more frustrating with the time-crunch than expected**

# Scripting:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Disclaimer: 

This script is very unsanitized and draft-like, it was written in a time-crunch and might not be optimal/borderline unreadable, and the approach to solving problems that arise on execution was made with speed more than care. It is also not 100% automated, I did some things manually to save time, though if I had more time to write it out, it can be 100% automatic. 

## Research

As I've never done anything like this using python before, I needed to do some research first to find which modules would prove helpful, I found the following modules:

### ColorThief

This module helped tremendously, I used it to get the dominant color/color palette of each frame, for further analysis.

### matplotlib.pyplot

Used this one to plot the dominant colors for debugging purposes while writing the script

### pynput

Used the `mouse` method, to re-input the  clicks in sequence, to given coordinates and to find the coordinates aswell. 

You can read more about each module [here](https://pypi.org)

## Writing the script:

A few unexpected issues kept breaking the script on runtime, some of them are:

- The `play` button kept interfering with the color palettes, so the video had to be cropped before being split into frames
- Each color is not on for exactly 1 frame, so we needed to check if the last item in the list is the same color as the current frame before appending. (The same color cannot be clicked twice in a row)
- The black background kept interfering with the `Blue` frames for some reason, so we had to apply a check for that to exclude the black color from the palettes
- Empty frames (timing issue), so we also had to exclude those
- The colors are not consistent, let's say a frame with `Green` pressed numbered `frame013.png` had the RGB value (0,253,0), there's a chance that `frame450.png` for example will have the green color as RGB (0,250,0), so we had to do some conversions to `int` to be able to actually compare the color and decide which color it is. I wrote exact values for each color which is something you shouldn't do, but it was faster than finding a range for each color

# Alternative solution:

This is the first option from the paths I listed above, I got it from discord after the competition ended.

```bash
